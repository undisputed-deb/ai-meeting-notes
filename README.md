## üöÄ Quick Start: Get Up and Running

Follow these steps to set up and run the AI Meeting Notes Dashboard locally:

### **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
cd your-repo-name
````

### **2. Backend Setup**

Navigate into the `backend` directory, set up a virtual environment, install dependencies, and configure your API keys.

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: .\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Configuration (`config.py`):**
Create a `config.py` file in the `/backend` directory and add your API keys and MongoDB URI.

```python
# config.py (DO NOT COMMIT THIS FILE TO VERSION CONTROL)
GEMINI_API_KEY = "your-gemini-api-key-here"
MONGO_URI = "your-mongodb-atlas-connection-string"
```

*Replace `"your-gemini-api-key-here"` and `"your-mongodb-atlas-connection-string"` with your actual credentials.*

**Start the Backend Server:**

```bash
python3 main.py
```

*The backend server will typically run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.*

### **3. Frontend Setup**

Open a new terminal, navigate to the `frontend` directory, install dependencies, and start the development server.

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

*The frontend development server will typically start on `http://localhost:5173`.*

### **4. Access the Application**

Open your web browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

(or the address provided by your Vite/React dev server).

## üîí Security & Best Practices

  - **API Key Management:** Always ensure your `config.py` file (or any file containing sensitive credentials) is listed in your `.gitignore` to prevent accidental exposure in public repositories.
  - **Environment Variables:** For production deployments, it's recommended to manage API keys and sensitive configurations using environment variables rather than hardcoded files.
  - **Dependency Management:** Regularly update your project dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.

## üìù Example Workflow

1.  **Upload:** Select your `.wav`, `.mp3`, or `.mp4` meeting audio file through the user-friendly interface.
2.  **Process:** The backend will securely receive the audio, initiate the transcription process, and then leverage Gemini AI for in-depth analysis.
3.  **Review:** Once processing is complete, the dashboard will present:
      * A concise executive summary.
      * The overall meeting sentiment.
      * An AI confidence score for the results.
      * The full transcribed text, often with timestamps.
4.  **Export:** Easily download a comprehensive PDF report of the analysis or copy the text directly to your clipboard.
5.  **Persistence:** All processed meeting data is automatically saved to your MongoDB Atlas instance for future reference.
